# Goomba Simulator 2025 #

You're a Goomba that collects the dropped artifacts that Mario left to restore balance to the Mushroom Kingdom!

Use the S key to suck in your fellow enemies so you can use their powers

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a Ludum Dare team to revisit past work, only a fool doesn't heed that call. This is the 10th anniversary sequel to our 2015 Ludum Dare entry!

# Controls:
