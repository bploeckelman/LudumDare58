# Goomba Simulator 2025 #

You're a Goomba that collects the dropped artifacts that Mario left to restore balance to the Mushroom Kingdom!

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a Ludum Dare team to revisit past work, only a fool doesn't heed that call. This is the 10th anniversary sequel to our 2015 Ludum Dare entry!

# Controls:

* WASD or controller to move
* Space to jump
* S to suck in other enemies and use their powers!
* S + Enter to jettison your enemy so you can use new powers!
